# Crime-and-real-estate-analysis
This project explored the intersection between crime and how this holds the intelligence to inform real estate sales and strategy.

Project Objective: 

The primary objective of this project is to support data-informed real estate decisions by analysing regional crime patterns across England. This will be achieved by identifying high- and low-risk locations using crime frequency, socioeconomic deprivation, and predictive crime trends. The final outcome will recommend two police jurisdictions for deeper modelling and future planning. 

Scope of Work: 

Conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of street-level crime data across four selected UK police forces: 

- Metropolitan Police (Greater London) 
- City of London Police 
- West Midlands Police 
- West Yorkshire Police 
- Integrate the 2019 English Indices of Deprivation (income, education, environment, housing, and service access) to contextualise crime at the LSOA level. 

Perform comprehensive statistical and spatial analysis, including: 

- Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis of crime variables 
- Time series trends and resolution rates 
- Crime distribution mapping via geospatial visualisation 
- Predictive modelling using lagged crime features (linear regression).

Key Findings: 

Crime is spatially concentrated in urban cores, especially the City of London, Westminster, Birmingham, and Manchester. Conversely, rural and suburban areas consistently report lower crime volumes. 

Income and education deprivation were the strongest correlates of crime; areas with multiple overlapping disadvantages experienced the highest crime frequencies. 

Surprisingly, poor service access correlated with lower crime, likely due to underreporting in rural or disconnected zones. 

The City of London recorded the highest crime per LSOA, yet also had the highest resolution rate, pointing to dense commercial activity coupled with effective policing. 

Predictive modelling revealed stable upward trends in crime, especially in West Midlands and West Yorkshire, suggesting emerging investment risk if left unaddressed.
